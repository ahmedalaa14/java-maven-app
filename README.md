# Java-maven-app .

The repository contains a simple Java application which outputs the string "Welcome to Java Maven Application" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the main application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a JUnit XML report.

The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline)
you'll be creating yourself during the tutorial and the `scripts` subdirectory
contains a shell script with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
the "Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
